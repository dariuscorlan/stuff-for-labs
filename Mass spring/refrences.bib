	abstract = {The spring is a marvel of human engineering and creativity. For one, it comes in so many varieties—the compression spring, the extension spring, the torsion spring, the coil spring, etc.—all of which serve different and specific functions. These functions in turn allow for the creation of many man-made objects, most of which emerged as part of the Scientific Revolution during the late 17th and 18th centuries.},
